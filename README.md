# nona
Antialiased vector drawing bring-your-own-renderer (or use ours) library

For a renderer, look at https://github.com/nokola/nonaquad
Based on nvg code from: https://github.com/sunli829/nvg. Going in fundamentally different direction from the original nvg/NanoVG to support higher quality anti-aliasing, ease of use, error handling, and speed.

Nona is completely platform-independent and 100% Rust.
